      I also need to research how to handle session information in Angular.
      My guess would be that you have some sort of user object that is held
      by the ApplicationController.  Obviously this would persist through state
      changes, but for page reloads I could either go back to rendering the
      page as a .mote file and in a script tag pass in the relevant session
      variable, or have angular make a post request to get the session on every
      page reload.

    Bilbo my old friend, this is going to be a night to remember.

    <!-- put into a state -->
